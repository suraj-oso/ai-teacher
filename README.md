# Gemini API - Student Help with Real-Time Question Solving via Camera

## Overview

This project integrates the Gemini API with a Next.js web application to help students solve questions in real-time using their device's camera. The application processes visual input through the camera, analyzes the content (questions), and provides solutions or guidance to the students instantly.

## Features

- **Real-Time Question Solving:** Students can use their camera to capture a question (text or math), and the app will return an answer or step-by-step solution.
- **Gemini API Integration:** The app utilizes the Gemini API to process the questions and generate accurate responses based on its natural language processing and vision capabilities.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Next.js, the web app provides a simple interface where students can start solving questions without any complex setup.
- **Camera Access:** Uses the device's camera to take pictures or scan questions that the Gemini API will process.
